# File Management

Learn how to upload, organize, and manage your markdown files.

## Uploading Files

### Upload Button
Click the **Upload Files** button in the left sidebar to open a file picker. Select one or multiple `.md` or `.markdown` files.

### Drag and Drop
Drag markdown files directly onto the application window. Files will be added to your workspace automatically.

## File List

All uploaded files appear in the left sidebar with:

- **File name** - The original filename
- **File size** - Displayed in human-readable format (KB, MB)
- **Upload date** - When the file was added

## Selecting Files

Click any file in the list to make it active. The active file:
- Appears highlighted with a white/dark background
- Is displayed in the editor/preview area
- Will be exported when clicking "Download HTML"

## Searching Files

Use the search bar at the top of the file list to filter files by name. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names.

Click the **X** button to clear the search.

## Deleting Files

### Single File
Hover over a file and click the trash icon that appears to delete it.

### Clear All
Click the **Clear All** button to remove all files. You'll need to click again to confirm the action.

## File Persistence

Files are stored in browser memory during your session. Refreshing the page will clear all uploaded files. Export your work before closing the browser.
